# HustleTime (front-end)

HustleTime is a one touch app that displays the MTA's nearest train stations from your current location, and the next few train arrivals at those given stations.

## Objective

Why leave where you are just to get to the subway station, and still have to wait 20 minutes? This app will instantly fetch your current location and display your nearest subway stations, along with their next few arrivals.
